The Newton Interpolator repository provides an interactive web application that aims to simplify the understanding of interpolation through visualization and hands-on learning. Interpolation is an abstract concept in mathematics and numerical analysis, and this project aims to bridge the gap by allowing users to witness interpolation in action.

## Overview

Interpolation involves estimating values between known data points. This project focuses on the Newton interpolation method and provides a user-friendly interface where users can interactively explore and visualize the interpolation process. The goal is to make learning interpolation easier and more engaging for users.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Users can observe the interpolation process in action, visually seeing how the intermediate values are estimated based on the given data points.
- **Hands-on Learning**: The web application allows users to interact with the interpolation algorithm, manipulating data points and observing the corresponding changes in the interpolated curve.
- **Accessible Web Application**: The application is designed to be easily accessible to everyone. Users can access it through any modern web browser installed on their devices, eliminating the need for specialized software installations.
